0. READ THE RULES FIRST.
1. Read the challenge carefully
2. The thread containing the challenge details is only for seeking clarification about the challenge. Do not share your code.
3. Each participant should create their own thread, one only, to share their work in progress, share their own progress comments and discuss their code with the group.
4. Facebook is rubbish at sharing code. Use something like Pastebin or GIT.
5. Since there is no prize there is no cheating, however if you re-use code, give credit. Plagiarism is frowned upon
6. You have as much leeway in deciding how to approach and code the programs as you wish. However, give consideration to producing efficient, readable and elegant code.

Challenge 1 of 4
================

There are a number of board games like Scrabble and Words With Friends that are won by placing down words on a board. Those words earn scores based on a combination of letter scores and tile scores. 

The Scrabble letter score chart can be found here: http://www.scrabblefinder.com/scrabble-letter-values/

Your task is to produce a Python program that asks the user for a single word using the 26 letters of the (English) alphabet, and tells the user the letter score for the input. The program should reject input that does not exclusively contain the letters a-z or A-Z. Case is not important.

The maximum word size will be 15 letters, as the Scrabble board is 15 tiles by 15 tiles.

OPTIONAL: 
Adapt your program to be able to include calculating the effect of double and triple letter score tiles and double and triple word scores
Give your program a user interface and graphical input/output. This includes using ASCII elements.
